# Machine learning
If you are new to Machine learning please check out the reference section to dive deeper in to this field.

## Introduction
Now a days, Machine Learning is been every where from Autonomous Driving Car to reccommendation system used by Amazon. Everybody knowingly or unknowingly is using Machine Learning. Have you ever wonder":
- How Facebook recommend you new friends? 
- How Siri reconize your voice?

Using machine learning softwares is fun but implementing them is more fun. It's like training a child and when you see it doing the work you become more curious about it.

## Machine Learning 
This repository is dedicated to Machine learning, in this you can find implementation of various machine learning algorithms. This repository is actually a result of various online tutorial. I tried to implement algorithm as easy as possible with full detail in Read me and working code.
It is suitable for beginners who want to find clear and concise example of machine learning algorithm. For readability, the tutorial includes both notebook and code with explanations.
From simple **numpy** to **sklearn** and all the way through **TensorFlow**, you can find example in each area.
